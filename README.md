This is a repository for the graphs generated in the research of the paper. It is organized as follows. The graphs are first divided into those made for the dynamic analysis and those made for the online analysis. Then each level of analysis is divided into the models that are used.

If there are any graphs that appear to be "missing", that is because for the subsample that was created, there were only observations that was either classified or misclassified.
